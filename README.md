# Towards In-Network Time-Decaying Aggregates for Heavy-Hitter Detection

## Overview
This repository contains the P4 implementation for the V1Model as well as the Python simulation scripts used to carry out the measurements for both HashAge and SkAge, proposed in the paper, *Towards In-Network Time-Decaying Aggregates for Heavy-Hitter Detection*, submitted to NSDI'21.

For details on the P4 implementation and the simulation scripts, please check out the [p4](./p4/) and [simulation](./simulation/) folders.
